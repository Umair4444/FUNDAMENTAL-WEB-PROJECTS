          <h2>Theoretical Physicist</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Albert Einstein</b> (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born
            theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of
            the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His
            work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
            Einstein is best known for his mass–energy equivalence formula
            <i>E = mc²</i>, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".
            He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
            theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the
            photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.
